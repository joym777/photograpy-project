      A journey through our past through the <div class="links"><a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/">JWST</a></div>
      and the <div class="links"><a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/">Hubble Space Telescope.</a></div>
      For over three decades the two telescopes combined have shown us the birth and death of stars, distant galaxies, and most importantly, brought images of cosmic bodies stretching back millions of years through light collection—both a science and an art: a coded message from the stars translated into what our eyes can appreciate.

   <div class="About">
    <p>
      The Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990, was humanity's first window to the universe beyond the distortion of Earth’s atmosphere. 
      Primarily observing visible and ultraviolet light, Hubble has returned sharp and detailed images of galaxies, nebulae, and stars.

   <div class="About">
    <p>
      JWST, launched in 2021, was built to see what Hubble could not. 
      Its unique gold-coated mirrors make it unforgettable, opening doors to observing infrared light—the heat signature of the universe. 
      This allows JWST to see through clouds of cosmic dust, revealing newborn stars, hidden galaxies, and the faint glow of the first galaxies formed after the Big Bang.
